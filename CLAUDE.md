# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Muffin Agent is a hierarchical multi-agent stock analysis system built with LangGraph. It orchestrates specialized agents that analyze stocks from multiple perspectives (technical, fundamental, news sentiment, etc.) to produce investment theses with price targets.

## Commands

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .          # runtime deps
pip install -e ".[dev]"   # + dev deps (ruff, mypy, pytest)

# Tests
pytest                           # all tests
pytest -m unit                   # unit tests only
pytest -m live                   # tests hitting live APIs
pytest tests/test_config.py      # single file
pytest --cov=muffin_agent tests/ # with coverage

# Code quality
ruff check src/ tests/           # lint
ruff format src/ tests/          # format
mypy src/                        # type check
```

## Architecture

The source lives in `src/muffin_agent/` and is organized as:

- **`config.py`** — Central `Configuration` Pydantic model. Manages LLM provider selection (OpenAI/Anthropic), API keys, and model parameters. Nodes get config via `Configuration.from_runnable_config(config)` which merges env vars with LangGraph's `RunnableConfig["configurable"]`. Call `configuration.get_llm()` to get a LangChain chat model. Also provides `get_mcp_connections()` for OpenBB MCP server access.

- **`prompts/`** — Jinja2-based prompt templates. Use `render_template(template_name, **kwargs)` from `prompts/__init__.py` to load and render templates from this directory.

- **`utils/observability.py`** — Optional LangFuse tracing via `setup_tracing()`. Returns callback handlers for `RunnableConfig["callbacks"]`. Gracefully degrades if LangFuse is unavailable.

- **`agents/data_collection/`** — Data collection agents using MCP tools with the ReAct pattern. Each agent is a sub-package with a single `__init__.py` containing:
  - `MCP_TOOLS` — list of allowed MCP tool name strings
  - `get_tools(config)` — async; loads filtered MCP tools via `MultiServerMCPClient`, returns them combined with any custom `@tool`-decorated functions
  - `build_graph(config)` — async; calls `get_tools()`, renders the Jinja2 prompt, builds the agent via `create_agent()` from `langchain.agents`

  Only create files that are needed — no empty stubs. Additional files (state.py, schemas.py, etc.) are added only when the agent requires them.

  Currently implemented: `equity_fundamentals/` (25 tools for financial statements, ratios, metrics, etc.)

- **`agents/criterion_evaluation/`** — Scaffolded but not yet implemented.

## Conventions

- **Ruff** with Google-style docstrings (`D401` imperative mood enforced). `D` and `UP` rules are relaxed in `tests/`.
- **Pydantic** models for all configuration and structured outputs.
- Python 3.11+ required.
- Environment variables for secrets (API keys, LangFuse credentials). See `.env` file.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for external data access (OpenBB).
- Use `create_agent` from `langchain.agents` for ReAct agents — do NOT use `create_react_agent` from `langgraph.prebuilt` (deprecated).
- KISS: no empty files or premature abstractions. Extract shared utilities only when patterns emerge across multiple agents.
