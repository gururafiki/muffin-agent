"""Flat state schema for the trading_decision module.

The package is fully self-contained — it does NOT depend on
``agents/investment/`` outputs. Inputs are caller-supplied (``ticker``,
``decision_date``, optional ``query`` / ``narrative``); the four analyst
agents fill in the analysis (``market_report``, ``fundamentals_report``,
``news_report``, ``sentiment_report``) before the Bull/Bear/Judge/
Trader/PM downstream nodes run.

The Bull/Bear debate still uses per-speaker ``Annotated[list[str],
operator.add]`` fields (not migrated yet — see the multi_agent framework
roadmap). The risk debate (Aggressive/Conservative/Neutral) is wired
through ``muffin_agent.multi_agent.build_conference_graph`` which
accumulates name-tagged ``AIMessage`` instances into
``risk_debate_messages`` and uses ``next_speaker`` for internal
routing.

Structured outputs (``investment_judge``, ``trader``, ``portfolio_decision``)
live in their own top-level dict fields populated by the synthesis/judge
nodes via ``Pydantic.model_dump()``.

Reflection fields (``past_reflections``, ``resolved_decisions``) are
populated by the reflection bookends.
